Raleigh Water Self-Service Update
If you previously had issues registering you will be contacted by email with additional information. If you need to make a payment, you can do so through our Pay as Guest option or through our over the phone service (888) 905-3169. Should you have any questions, please contact raleighwaterselfservice@raleighnc.gov .

Your account number is on your bill. If you don't have access to your most recent statement (printed copy or an email,) that's okay! The easiest solution is to simply wait and complete your registration or make your payment once your next bill comes in.

Please note once your newly set up AutoPay is active, it will draft the full balance due on your next due date which may include past due charges if not previously paid.
