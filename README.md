InMotion Hosting Review Going Into 2026: Honest experiences, feedback, and questions
We know choosing a hosting provider often comes down to real experiences, not just specs or feature lists.

This thread is a place for anyone using InMotion Hosting to share honest feedback, ask questions, and connect directly with our team and community.

If you’ve been hosting with us for a while, or just started out, we’d love to hear from you:

What has worked best for you, such as speed, uptime, support, or tools?

What could we improve?

Which plan are you using (Shared, VPS, Dedicated, or Managed WordPress)?

We’ll be checking in regularly to answer questions and collect feedback to share with our internal teams. Good or bad, we genuinely want to hear it. Transparency helps us keep improving.

Thanks for helping us build a better hosting experience for everyone here.
